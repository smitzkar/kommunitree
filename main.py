2025-09-03 A NEW PLAN  

Create a fork of the project:  
- actually embrace my silly abstractions (to be free from associations and baggage) 
- use them in the final product!  
-> no more `sensor_manager`, but `supervisor_owl`, `squirrel_1` instead of `message_carrier_1`, `crows` for `api calls` etc.
=>  create a fantasy, where all the critters living in, on, and around the tree work together to give it a voice, to let the humans know that their actions are impacting them 

- let Julia replace it with more serious names, via find-and-replace, if she wants to
